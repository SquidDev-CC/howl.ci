		<h2>Caching ComputerCraft versions</h2>
		<p>
			Every time howl.ci runs you have to wait for the ComputerCraft file to be downloaded. Instead, we can
			utilise Travis's <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching/" target="_blank">caching capabilities</a>
			to save the ComputerCraft file.
		</p>

		<p>
			In order to cache, we'll have to download to a directory instead. We'll choose to use <code>$HOME/.ccjars</code>
			but we'll have to create that first. Then we simply set Travis to download that.
		</p>

<pre class="box">
install:
  - mkdir -p $HOME/.cc-jars
  - wget -O howlci.jar https://dl.bintray.com/squiddev/maven/org/squiddev/howl.ci/{{runner_version}}/howl.ci-{{runner_version}}.jar
cache:
  directories:
  - $HOME/.cc-jars
</pre>

		<p>
			Then we just need to instruct the howl.ci runner to download into that directory instead. This is a trivial
			addition to our <code>.howl.properties</code> file.
		</p>

<pre class="box">
computercraft.file=${HOME}/.cc-jars/ComputerCraft1.79.jar
</pre>

		<p>
			The first time you run under caching it'll still download the files, but after that you'll never
			have to wait again!
