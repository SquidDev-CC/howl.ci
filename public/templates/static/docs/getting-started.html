		<h2>Getting started</h2>

		<p>
			Before we do anything else you'll need to <a href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank">create a repository</a>
			for your code on GitHub if you haven't got one already.
		</p>

		<h3 id="enabling-build">Enabling your build on Travis</h3>
		<p>
			howl.ci uses <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank">Travis.org</a> to execute your code. So first
			we need to setup Travis. You can find more detailed instructions and further documentation
			<a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/#To-get-started-with-Travis-CI%3A" target="_blank">on the Travis
			website</a>.
		</p>

		<ul class="list">
			<li><a href="https://travis-ci.org/auth" target="_blank">Sign in to Travis</a> with your GitHub account</li>
			<li>
				Go to your <a href="https://travis-ci.org/profile" target="_blank">profile page</a> and find the
				repository you want to build.
			</li>
			<li>Enable building for that repository. You should just be able to flip the green switch.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			That's it: you've setup Travis to build your code! However Travis doesn't know anything about
			ComputerCraft, so we need to configure that next.
		</p>

		<h3 id="adding-howl">Adding howl.ci</h3>
		<p>
			Travis uses a <code>.travis.yml</code> file to change how your build works. To execute within ComputerCraft's
			environment we need to download an emulator and execute your code in there. Let's take a look:
		</p>

<pre class="box">
jdk:
  - oraclejdk8
install:
  - wget -O howlci.jar https://dl.bintray.com/squiddev/maven/org/squiddev/howl.ci/0.2/howl.ci-0.2.jar
script:
  - java -jar howlci.jar
</pre>

		<h3>Making your builds do something</h3>
		<p>
			The issue here is that howl.ci, and so Travis has no way of telling if your build has succeeded or not. To do this
			you should use the <code>howlci</code> API. This provides a <code>howlapi.status(status:string, message:string)</code>
			that sets the status of your build.
		</p>
		<p>
			Builds have three states: "success" for when everything went OK, "failure" for when your tests didn't go right and
			"error" for when something unexpected that you were not expecting: such as everything crashing. If you don't
			terminate with a status then howl.ci will presume the build errored.
		</p>

		<h3>Running your build</h3>
		<p>
			You should now be able to commit and push your code. howl.ci will look for a <code>startup</code> file
			and execute it. Make sure you have one before you push!
		</p>

		<p>
			You can visit your repository's builds by using the textbox in the page header. Click on the latest build,
			it should be a pleasant green colour. If not: go back and check you've got everything right.
		</p>

		<p>
			You should now see a log and a ComputerCraft terminal displaying the results of your build. You can use
			the playback bar to go through your build and see what the was output when.
		</p>

		<h3 id="next">Moving on</h3>
		<p>
			Of course the capabilities of howl.ci don't stop there. If you wish you can add tweak howl.ci to
			execute in different versions of ComputerCraft, with or without CCTweaks or using different monitor
			resolutions. This can be done through the <code>.howl.ci.properties</code> file which is discussed in detail
			on <a href="{{base}}docs/configuring">another page</a>.
