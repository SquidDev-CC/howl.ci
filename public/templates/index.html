<h2>howl.ci</h2>
<p>
	howl.ci is a project which aims to provide a continuous integration service to ComputerCraft users.
</p>
<p>
	Builds are executed by <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" title="The Travis CI provider" target="_blank">Travis</a>
	and the terminal output captured. howl.ci then scrapes these logs and renders them in place on the website.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
	You can view <a href="?p=builds&repo=SquidDev-CC/Howl">historic builds of Howl</a>. You can also render log files from
	<a href="?p=url&url=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/SquidDev/b3e88899a86ee73fa2510389b141e9e3/raw/terminal_codes.txt">aribtrary
	urls</a>
</p>

<h3>Getting set up</h3>
<p>
	Firstly you'll need to get set up with Travis. You need to download the executor and run it in the relevent
	directory. We'll create a <code>.travis.yml</code> file like so:
</p>
<pre class="box">
jdk:
  - oraclejdk8
install:
  - wget -O howlci.jar https://dl.bintray.com/squiddev/maven/org/squiddev/howl.ci/0.1/howl.ci-0.1.jar
script:
  - java -jar howlci.jar
</pre>
<p>
	You'll probably want to configure howl.ci for your particular use case. To do this you'll need a
	<code>.howl.properties</code> file.
</p>
<pre class="box">
computer.0.saveDir=.
computer.0.startup=.build.lua
</pre>
<p>
	This configures the initial computer to run in the current directory and execute the .build.lua file. You don't need
	to specify that second line if you have a <code>startup</code> file.
</p>

<h3>Making your builds do something</h3>
<p>
	The issue here is that howl.ci, and so Travis has no way of telling if your build has succeeded or not. To do this
	you should use the <code>howlci</code> API. This provides a <code>howlapi.status(status:string, message:string)</code>
	that sets the status of your build.
</p>
<p>
	Builds have three states: "success" for when everything went OK, "failure" for when your tests didn't go right and
	"error" for when something unexpected that you were not expecting: such as everything crashing. If you don't
	terminate with a status then howl.ci will presume the build errored.
